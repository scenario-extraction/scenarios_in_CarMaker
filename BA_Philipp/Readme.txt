Dear user,

instead of creating one large "Readme" file I decided to use a decentralised approach where I document each folder's, script's or function's purpose at their own
location.
For this purpose I created multiple text files called "Readme" or "Remark" which explain how to use the respective elements. 
Furthermore I added detailed documentations and comments in the respective Matlab scripts and functions.

If questions arrise, please feel free to contact me via email: Philippmetzger2@gmail.com

I used as little absolute paths as possible and used relative paths instead, so most scripts and functions will still run properly, if this folder structure is kept 
intact, even when it is moved to a new location.
Yet, some paths in some scripts or functions may have to be adjusted before running.

"Traffic Object Dimension Estimation" and "Traffic Sign Recognition" can be regarded as independent packages. They do not reference to each other in any way and can
be moved to different locations independently.

For creating and running this code I had the following installed:
