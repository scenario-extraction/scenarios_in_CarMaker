For running traffic sign detection and recognition, run "main_ts_detection_and_recognition"

"001 Data" contains all data needed for running any script or function in this project

When running "main_ts_detection_and_recognition" four files with intermediate results will be created and saved here. 
Their names begin with "tsdr_..."

The purpose of "run_main_ts_detection_and_recognition_as_fct" and "main_ts_detection_and_recognition_as_fct" is to find a good value for "delay" which is a variable
used in "main_ts_detection_and_recognition"



Paths in scripts may have to be adjusted before running
