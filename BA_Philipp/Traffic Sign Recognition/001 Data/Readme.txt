Subfolders of "000 Scenarios" contain all the data needed for respective scenarios.

For using them, simply delete the currently present versions of "CM images for detection and classification", "erg, radar", "ground truth", "tensors" and
"This is Scenario ..." and replace them with copies of the scenario you want to use. 

Text document 'This is...' simply is a helpful marker in order to know which scenario is currently located here.
