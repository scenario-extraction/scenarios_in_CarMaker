This Testrun has been created in CarMaker 8.0. 
Newer CM versions don't execute it properly.
For simulation of this Testrun (in order to get .erg file and create foto sequences) use CM 8.0!

For extracting data from .erg file use older Matlab (I used R2017b) because newer Matlab versions are not compatible with CM 8.0

When the data is created and extracted, it can be processed further with Matlab R2019b and CM 8.1.1
